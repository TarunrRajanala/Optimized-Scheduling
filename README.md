Optimizing Combination Chemotherapy with Dynamic Programming

Project Overview:

This project focuses on applying dynamic programming to optimize treatment plans in a simulated combination chemotherapy scenario. Given a set of medicines with variable impacts over time, the algorithm determines the optimal hours to allocate to each medicine within a fixed time limit to maximize treatment impact. This project showcases the application of algorithms to healthcare optimization challenges.

Key Features:

Dynamic Programming Optimization: Utilizes a dynamic programming approach to allocate time effectively across multiple medicines, ensuring maximum therapeutic impact within the available time.
Treatment Plan Calculation: Produces a detailed treatment plan that specifies the time allocation for each medicine based on its unique impact function.
Real-World Healthcare Considerations: Considers practical constraints such as time and explores potential additions, like cost limits, to simulate real-world healthcare optimization.

Skills Demonstrated:

Dynamic Programming, Develops a solution that maximizes impact within constraints, using DP techniques to manage complex allocations.
Runtime analysis and algorithmic adjustments for additional constraints, demonstrating scalability and adaptability.
Discusses broader implications of algorithms in healthcare, such as cost constraints and accessibility, connecting technical solutions to real-world scenarios.
